# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [mqtt5 0.31.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- **OpenTelemetry span instrumentation** - distributed tracing spans across broker hot paths behind `#[cfg(feature = "opentelemetry")]`: connect, disconnect, publish, subscribe, unsubscribe, QoS handshake (puback/pubrec/pubrel/pubcomp), will message, route, deliver (regular and shared subscriptions), and bridge forward
- **OpenTelemetry metrics bridge** - `MetricsBridge` registers 10 observable instruments (clients connected/total/maximum, messages sent/received, publish sent/received, bytes sent/received, uptime) that read `BrokerStats` atomics via OTLP periodic export
- **Telemetry provider lifecycle** - `OnceLock`-stored `SdkTracerProvider` and `SdkMeterProvider` with `shutdown_telemetry()` that flushes and shuts down both providers on broker shutdown
- `TelemetryConfig::with_metrics_enabled()` builder method and `init_meter_provider()` for OTLP metric export setup

## [mqtt5 0.30.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Optional transport features** - QUIC and WebSocket transports are now behind cargo feature flags (`transport-quic`, `transport-websocket`), both enabled by default for backward compatibility
  - `cargo add mqtt5 --no-default-features` gives TCP/TLS only, with no quinn or tungstenite dependencies
  - Modules gated at declaration site — disabled transports simply don't exist rather than providing stubs
  - Clear compile-time errors when attempting to use a disabled transport (e.g., `ws://` URL without `transport-websocket`)
  - Broker rejects config requesting disabled transports with descriptive error messages

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.12.0] / [mqtt5 0.29.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **QUIC error code enums** - `QuicConnectionCode` (5 variants) and `QuicStreamCode` (16 variants) for typed QUIC APPLICATION_CLOSE and RESET_STREAM codes per MQTT-next §12
- **Error tolerance levels** - `handle_stream_error()` implements graduated response based on `FlowFlags.err_tolerance` per MQTT-next §11: Level 0 closes connection, Level 1 resets stream and discards flow, Level 2 resets stream but preserves flow state for recovery
- **Quinn error parsing** - `QuicCloseReason`, `StreamResetReason`, `StreamStopReason` enums with `parse_connection_error()`, `parse_read_error()`, `parse_write_error()` for structured QUIC error diagnostics
- **STOP_SENDING on data stream errors** - Broker sends STOP_SENDING with `IncompletePacket` code when a data stream read fails
- 7 new `ReasonCode` variants: `MqoqPersistentTopic`, `MqoqOptionalHeader`, `MqoqFlowPacketCancelled`, `MqoqFlowRefused`, `MqoqDiscardState`, `MqoqServerPushNotWelcome`, `MqoqRecoveryFailed`
- `ReasonCode::to_quic_stream_code()` and `ReasonCode::from_quic_stream_code()` conversions

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `MqoqProtocolError` renamed to `MqoqNotFlowOwner`** to match spec naming
- All `conn.close()` and `send.reset()` calls now use typed error codes instead of hard-coded `0u32` / `0xC1`

## [mqtt5 0.28.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.25.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **QUIC 0-RTT connection resumption** - Reconnecting clients can skip the TLS handshake round trip per MQTT-next §8.1
  - Broker `enable_early_data` config sets `max_early_data_size` and `send_half_rtt_data` on rustls `ServerConfig`
  - Client caches `quinn::ClientConfig` (session ticket store) across reconnections for `Connecting::into_0rtt()`
  - Automatic 1-RTT fallback when no session ticket exists or server rejects early data
  - `MqttClient::was_zero_rtt()` reports whether the current connection used 0-RTT
  - `--quic-early-data` CLI flag on broker, pub, sub, and bench commands

## [mqtt5 0.27.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.24.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Discard flow state at peer** - Client can force the broker to discard flow state per MQoQ §9.16
  - `MqttClient::discard_flow(flow_id)` opens bidirectional QUIC stream with `clean_start=1` and all persistent flags cleared
  - Broker `accept_bi` loop dispatches to `spawn_discard_handler` which validates the discard signal, removes the flow from `FlowRegistry`, and responds with FIN
  - `FlowFlags::is_discard_signal()` and `FlowFlags::discard()` for detecting and constructing discard signals
  - Non-discard bidirectional streams are reset with error code `0xC1` (`ERROR_NO_FLOW_STATE`)

### Changed

- Refactored `run_quic_handler_inner` into `spawn_datagram_reader`, `spawn_bi_accept_loop`, `spawn_uni_accept_loop` helpers

## [mqtt5 0.26.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **ALPN negotiation for MQTT-next** - Client and broker negotiate `MQTT-next` vs `mqtt` ALPN per MQoQ §7.4
  - Broker advertises both `MQTT-next` and `mqtt` ALPNs; clients requesting Advanced Multistreams get `MQTT-next`
  - Client offers `["MQTT-next", "mqtt"]` when `enable_flow_headers` is true, `["mqtt"]` otherwise
  - Negotiated ALPN read from `HandshakeData` after QUIC handshake; downgrade logged as warning
  - Flow headers gated on successful `MQTT-next` negotiation — never sent to peers that didn't negotiate it

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `QuicTransport::into_split()` return type** - Returns `QuicSplitResult` struct instead of 6-element tuple
- **`QuicStreamManager` now configured with flow header state** from `QuicSplitResult` (flow_headers, flow_expire_interval, flow_flags)

## [mqtt5 0.25.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.23.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 1.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **QUIC connection migration** - Client and server support for seamless network address changes
  - `MqttClient::migrate()` triggers connection migration via `Endpoint::rebind()` to a new UDP socket
  - Server-side detection via `ClientHandler::check_quic_migration()` polling `Connection::remote_address()` after each packet
  - `ResourceMonitor::update_connection_ip()` atomically transitions per-IP connection tracking
  - All streams, subscriptions, and sessions survive migration transparently
  - Non-QUIC transports return a descriptive error; not-connected state returns `NotConnected`

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.11.0] / [mqtt5 0.24.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.22.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 1.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Server redirect via CONNACK** - Load balancer support using MQTT v5.0 `UseAnotherServer` (0x9C) reason code
  - `LoadBalancerConfig` with consistent-hash backend selection based on client ID
  - `BrokerConfig::with_load_balancer()` and `--load-balancer-backend` CLI flag (repeatable)
  - Client automatically follows up to 3 redirect hops
  - Both `UseAnotherServer` and `ServerMoved` (0x9D) reason codes handled
  - WASM broker support via `addLoadBalancerBackend()`/`clearLoadBalancerBackends()` on `BrokerConfig`
  - WASM client returns structured `{type: "redirect", url: "..."}` error for application-level handling
  - `MqttError::UseAnotherServer` variant for clean redirect error propagation
  - TLS redirect preserves CA certificate configuration across redirect hops
  - Empty client IDs distribute across backends via monotonic counter (not static hash)

### Fixed

- **`select_backend` panic on empty backends** - Returns `Option<&str>` instead of indexing empty vec

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.10.0] / [mqtt5 0.23.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.21.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 1.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Per-client outbound rate limiting** - `max_outbound_rate_per_client` config limits messages/second delivered to each subscriber; hot-reloadable via SIGHUP (native) and config change (WASM)
- **`PublishAction` event hooks** - `on_client_publish` now returns `PublishAction` (`Continue`, `Handled`, `Transform`) for intercepting and modifying publishes before routing
- **`ServerDeliveryStrategy` config** - Broker-side QUIC delivery strategy (`ControlOnly`, `PerTopic`, `PerPublish`) replaces client-driven stream strategy for server-to-client data paths
- **Datagram type discrimination** - QUIC datagram receiver distinguishes MQTT packets from non-MQTT datagrams instead of treating all as errors
- **Unidirectional QUIC streams** - Data streams changed from bidirectional to unidirectional for server-to-client delivery, reducing resource overhead
- **QUIC flow control tuning** - Configurable stream receive window (256KB), connection receive window (1MB), and send window (1MB)
- **Stale subscription cleanup** - Router periodically removes subscriptions for disconnected clients during storage cleanup cycle
- **`--quic-delivery-strategy` CLI flag** - Broker CLI option to set server delivery strategy
- **`--trace-dir` bench flag** - Per-message trace CSV output for latency analysis with topic, sequence, stream ID, and timing columns
- **Bench HOL blocking metrics** - `inter_topic_spread`, `detrended_correlation`, `spike_isolation_ratio`, and `inter_arrival_cluster_ratio` metrics in HOL mode JSON output
- **Bench payload sequence numbers** - Raw payload format now encodes a 4-byte sequence number at offset 8 for message ordering analysis
- **WebSocket bridge support** - WASM broker `addBridgeWebSocket()` and `BridgeConnection.connect_ws()` for WebSocket-based bridge connections

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `PublishPacket.stream_id`** - New `stream_id: Option<u64>` field on `PublishPacket` and `Message` (mqtt5-protocol)
- **BREAKING: `on_client_publish` return type** - Changed from `Pin<Box<Future<Output = ()>>>` to `Pin<Box<Future<Output = PublishAction>>>`
- **BREAKING: `QuicStreamManager::open_data_stream`** - Returns `SendStream` instead of `(SendStream, RecvStream)` (unidirectional streams)
- **`DataPerSubscription` deprecated** - Client-side `StreamStrategy::DataPerSubscription` marked deprecated; use `ServerDeliveryStrategy::PerTopic` instead
- **`BrokerConfig` new fields** - `max_outbound_rate_per_client: u32` and `server_delivery_strategy: ServerDeliveryStrategy` added with defaults

### Fixed

- **File backend queue filename collision** - Queue filenames now use a global atomic sequence counter instead of `timestamp % 1_000_000`, preventing overwrites when multiple messages are queued in the same millisecond

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.0.0] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **BREAKING: camelCase JS API** - All exported types, methods, properties, and parameter names now follow JavaScript conventions
  - Types: `WasmBroker` → `Broker`, `WasmMqttClient` → `MqttClient`, `WasmBrokerConfig` → `BrokerConfig`, etc.
  - Methods: `connect_with_options` → `connectWithOptions`, `subscribe_with_callback` → `subscribeWithCallback`, etc.
  - Properties: `config.max_clients` → `config.maxClients`, `config.allow_anonymous` → `config.allowAnonymous`, etc.
  - See [MIGRATION-1.0.md](crates/mqtt5-wasm/MIGRATION-1.0.md) for the complete rename mapping

## [mqtt5 0.22.10] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.11] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.7] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Server-side per-topic QUIC stream delivery** - Broker routes publishes to topic-specific QUIC streams via `ServerStreamManager`, enabling independent multiplexing per topic
- **Bench tool `--payload-format` flag** - Compare serialization overhead with raw, json, bebytes, and compressed-json payload formats
- **Bench tool HOL-blocking mode improvements** - Rate-limited publishing (`--rate`) for clean inter-topic correlation measurement
- **SSH keepalive in experiment scripts** - Prevents SSH timeout on long-running remote bench sessions

### Changed

- **QUIC client endpoint lifecycle** - `into_split()` returns the endpoint; disconnect uses `wait_idle` with timeout instead of fixed sleep, adapting to actual RTT
- **Experiment infrastructure** - Bench connections use stable internal VPC IP; SSH/SCP use external IP separately

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.9] / [mqtt5 0.22.9] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.10] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.6] / [mqtt5-conformance 0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **mqtt5-conformance crate** - MQTT v5.0 OASIS specification conformance test suite
  - 197 tests across 22 test files covering sections 1, 3, 4, and 6
  - Tracks all 247 normative `[MQTT-x.x.x-y]` statements in a structured TOML manifest
  - Raw TCP packet builder (`RawMqttClient`, `RawPacketBuilder`) for malformed input testing
  - In-process `ConformanceBroker` harness with memory-backed storage on random loopback port
  - Machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable coverage report generation
- **Inbound receive maximum enforcement** - Broker sends DISCONNECT 0x93 when client exceeds receive maximum [MQTT-3.3.4-8]
- **`Properties::get_maximum_packet_size()`** - Property accessor for Maximum Packet Size

### Fixed

- **DUP flag propagation** - Router no longer propagates publisher's DUP flag to subscribers; resets to false before forwarding [MQTT-3.3.1-1]
- **PUBCOMP reason codes** - PUBCOMP now returns `PacketIdentifierNotFound` when PUBREL arrives for non-existent packet ID instead of always sending Success [MQTT-3.7.2-1]
- **Will message suppression** - DISCONNECT with reason code 0x04 (`DisconnectWithWillMessage`) now correctly preserves the will message [MQTT-3.14.4-3]
- **Queued message drain data loss** - Messages are no longer removed from storage before successful transmission; unsent messages are re-queued
- **WASM UNSUBACK reason codes** - WASM broker now returns `NoSubscriptionExisted` when unsubscribing from non-existent subscription [MQTT-3.11.3-1]
- **CONNACK v3.1.1 construction** - Fixed CONNACK packet builder to use protocol-version-aware encoding for v3.1.1 clients
- **DUP+QoS0 rejection** - Reject PUBLISH with DUP=1 and QoS=0 as malformed [MQTT-3.3.1-2]
- **Will QoS validation** - Reject CONNECT when Will QoS exceeds server maximum via CONNACK 0x9A [MQTT-3.2.2-11]
- **Will Retain validation** - Reject CONNECT with Will Retain=1 when retain not supported via CONNACK 0x9B [MQTT-3.2.2-10]

- **Response topic validation** - Validate Response Topic contains no wildcard characters [MQTT-3.3.2-11]
- **ShareName validation** - Reject shared subscriptions with malformed or wildcard-containing ShareName [MQTT-3.8.3-4]
- **NoLocal on shared subscriptions** - Send DISCONNECT 0x82 when NoLocal=1 on shared subscription [MQTT-3.8.3-4]
- **Topic filter syntax validation** - Validate topic filter syntax for both regular and shared subscriptions [MQTT-3.8.3-1]

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.8] / [mqtt5 0.22.8] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.9] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.5] - 2026-02-16

### Security

- **Max packet size enforcement** - Enforce max packet size before buffer allocation in all packet read paths (native + WASM), preventing OOM from malicious remaining-length fields
- **CompositeAuthProvider authorization modes** - `AuthorizationMode` enum (`PrimaryOnly`/`Or`/`And`) with safe `PrimaryOnly` default — fallback provider no longer silently grants access
- **Read timeouts** - Added read timeouts to `handle_packets` (keepalive × 1.5) and `handle_packets_no_keepalive` (300s zombie guard) to prevent idle connection resource exhaustion
- **Decompression bomb limits** - `max_decompressed_size` (default 10MB) on all 4 codec structs (native gzip/deflate, WASM gzip/deflate) to block decompression bombs
- **Per-username rate limiting** - Auth rate limiter now tracks both IP and username, blocking credential stuffing attacks that rotate source IPs
- **ConnectPacket password redaction** - `ConnectPacket` and `ConnectOptions` (mqtt5-protocol) now use custom `Debug` impls that print `[REDACTED]` instead of raw password bytes, preventing credential leakage via `{:?}` formatting
- **EnhancedAuthResult auth_data redaction** - `EnhancedAuthResult` now uses a custom `Debug` impl that prints `<N bytes>` instead of raw authentication exchange data (SCRAM challenges, JWT tokens)
- **QUIC packet debug log sanitized** - QUIC data stream reader now logs only the packet type name at `debug!` level instead of the full packet contents, preventing payload and credential exposure in debug logs
- **Password file parse error log sanitized** - Malformed password/certificate file lines are no longer included in warning log messages, preventing accidental exposure of hashes or secrets on format errors

### Added

- **`Packet::packet_type_name()`** - Returns the MQTT packet type as a static string (e.g., `"CONNECT"`, `"PUBLISH"`) for safe logging without exposing packet contents

### Changed

- **WASM reconnect defaults** - `max_attempts` defaults to 20 (was unlimited); WebSocket URL scheme validated; warning logged for credentials over `ws://`
- **Resource monitor locks** - Switched to `parking_lot::RwLock` (no lock poisoning)
- **ALPN protocol validation** - Invalid ALPN protocols are filtered with a warning instead of panicking

## [mqtt5 0.22.7] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **File backend atomic write race** - Fixed race condition where concurrent `remove_dir_all` could delete the temp file between write and rename, causing ENOENT errors when queuing messages for offline clients

## [mqtt5 0.22.6] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.8] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Browser connectivity detection** - WASM client detects browser online/offline state during reconnection
  - `on_connectivity_change(callback)` fires when the browser goes online or offline
  - `is_browser_online()` returns current network state synchronously
  - Reconnection pauses while offline (no wasted retries) and resumes immediately when network returns
  - Backoff resets after a network outage since the failure was connectivity, not server rejection
- **Connectivity detection example** - New `connectivity-detection` example demonstrating online/offline handling

### Fixed

- **Flaky session security tests** - Replaced millisecond-precision timestamps with atomic counter for temp file naming, preventing filename collisions when concurrent tests execute within the same millisecond
- **Release workflow artifacts** - Fixed GitHub Actions release workflow to correctly flatten artifact directories before uploading to the release

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.7] / [mqtt5 0.22.5] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.6] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **`x-mqtt-client-id` injection** - Broker injects publisher's MQTT client_id as `x-mqtt-client-id` user property on every PUBLISH (strips client-supplied values first to prevent spoofing). Applies to normal publishes, will messages, and bridge paths in both native and WASM brokers
- **Echo suppression** - Configurable delivery suppression when a user property value matches the subscriber's client_id
  - `EchoSuppressionConfig` with `enabled` and `property_key` (default `x-origin-client-id`)
  - Defaults to `x-origin-client-id` (not `x-mqtt-client-id`) because intermediaries like MQDB republish with their own client_id — only the application-layer origin property tracks the real causation chain
  - Hot-reloadable via SIGHUP (native) and `update_config()` (WASM)
  - `BrokerConfig::with_echo_suppression()` and `WasmBrokerConfig` setters
- **`Properties::get_user_property_value()`** - Single-value user property lookup by key

### Changed

- Router construction extracted to `MqttBroker::build_router()` for reuse between init and reload paths

### Fixed

- **CLI TLS broker tests** use `--storage-backend memory` instead of default file backend, preventing failures from stale/corrupt storage left by prior runs

## [mqtt5 0.22.4] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.5] - 2026-02-10

### Security

- **JWT exp claim enforcement** - Tokens without `exp` (expiration) claim are now rejected instead of being treated as never-expiring. Applies to both `JwtAuthProvider` and `FederatedJwtAuthProvider`
- **JWT sub claim enforcement** - Tokens without `sub` (subject) claim are now rejected instead of defaulting to empty string identity
- **JWT algorithm confusion prevention** - Verifier selection now uses `kid` (key ID) header matching instead of trusting the `alg` header from untrusted tokens. Single-verifier configurations ignore the header algorithm entirely
- **Session-to-user binding** - Sessions now store the authenticated `user_id`. On reconnect with `clean_start=false`, the broker rejects the connection if the reconnecting user doesn't match the session owner
- **ACL re-check on session restore** - When restoring subscriptions from a previous session, each topic filter is re-authorized against current ACL rules. Subscriptions that no longer pass authorization are pruned
- **Certificate auth transport guard** - `cert:` prefixed client IDs are now rejected at the transport layer unless the connection has a verified TLS client certificate. Prevents spoofing certificate identity over plain TCP, WebSocket, or QUIC connections
- **Certificate auth fingerprint validation** - `CertificateAuthProvider` now validates TLS peer certificate fingerprints against registered fingerprints instead of trusting `cert:` prefix in client IDs. Fingerprints must be exactly 64 hex characters
- **SCRAM state collision fix** - SCRAM authentication now rejects concurrent authentication attempts for the same `client_id`, preventing auth state from being clobbered
- **QUIC bridge TLS verification** - QUIC bridges now default to certificate verification enabled (`secure: true`), matching QUIC's mandatory TLS requirement
- **WebSocket path enforcement** - Requests to non-configured WebSocket paths now return HTTP 404 instead of silently accepting the connection
- **WebSocket Origin validation** - New `allowed_origins` configuration on `WebSocketServerConfig` for Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) prevention. When set, connections without a matching `Origin` header are rejected with HTTP 403
- **Bridge config password redaction** - `BridgeConfig` Debug output now prints `[REDACTED]` instead of the plaintext password
- **Password field redaction in logs** - Auth provider tracing instrumentation now skips password fields to prevent credential leakage in logs
- **NoVerification struct restricted** - `NoVerification` (TLS certificate bypass) changed from `pub` to `pub(crate)` to prevent accidental misuse by downstream crates
- **Topic name validation on publish** - Broker now validates topic names on incoming PUBLISH packets after topic alias resolution, rejecting invalid topics before routing
- **Topic filename bijective encoding** - File storage backend replaced `_slash_` topic-to-filename encoding with percent-encoding (`/` → `%2F`, `%` → `%25`), preventing collisions between topics like `a/b` and `a_slash_b`
- **fsync for file storage durability** - Atomic file writes now call `sync_data()` before rename, ensuring data reaches disk before the old file is replaced
- **SCRAM password zeroization** - Client-side SCRAM password storage now uses `Zeroizing<String>` which automatically zeros memory on drop
- **Regex compilation caching** - JWT claim pattern regexes are now compiled once at deserialization time instead of on every authentication attempt. Invalid regex patterns fail at config load
- **innerHTML XSS prevention** - All 19 WASM example HTML files replaced `innerHTML +=` with safe DOM manipulation (`createElement` + `textContent` + `appendChild`)
- **WASM enhanced auth user_id propagation** - Fixed missing `user_id` capture in WASM broker's enhanced auth success path
- **Packet ID collision prevention** - After restoring inflight messages on reconnect, the broker now scans both `outbound_inflight` and `inflight_publishes` maps to advance the packet ID counter past any occupied IDs, preventing collisions in both native and WASM brokers
- **Session user binding hardened** - Anonymous-to-authenticated and authenticated-to-anonymous session mismatches are now correctly rejected (previously only authenticated-to-different-authenticated was caught)

### Fixed

- **InflightMessage expiry survives serialization** - Replaced `#[serde(skip)]` `expires_at` with serializable `expires_at_secs` (epoch seconds) plus an in-memory cache, so expiry is preserved across file backend round-trips

### Changed

- **MemoryBackend inflight storage** - Inflight messages now stored in `HashMap<(u16, InflightDirection), InflightMessage>` per client instead of `Vec<InflightMessage>`, giving O(1) insert/remove/lookup instead of O(n) linear scan

## [mqtt5 0.22.3] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.5] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **QoS 2 inflight persistence** - Broker persists in-flight QoS 2 messages across client reconnections
  - `InflightMessage` struct stores decomposed publish data with direction (Inbound/Outbound) and phase (AwaitingPubrec/AwaitingPubrel/AwaitingPubcomp)
  - `StorageBackend` trait extended with `store_inflight_message`, `get_inflight_messages`, `remove_inflight_message`, `remove_all_inflight_messages`
  - `MemoryBackend` and `FileBackend` implementations for inflight storage
  - On reconnect with `clean_start=false`, broker resends outbound PUBLISH (DUP=1) or PUBREL and restores inbound inflight state
  - `clean_start=true` clears all inflight messages
  - Message expiry tracking for inflight messages with automatic cleanup
  - Applies to both native and WASM brokers

- **WASM outbound inflight tracking** - WASM broker now tracks outbound QoS 2 messages
  - Assigns packet IDs and persists outbound inflight state in the forward loop
  - `handle_pubrec`/`handle_pubcomp` update and remove inflight storage
  - `resend_inflight_messages` on session restore

- **QoS 2 recovery demo** (`examples/qos2-recovery/`) - Interactive browser demo showing QoS 2 mid-flight recovery after connection interruption

## [mqtt5 0.22.2] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.4] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Missing `user_id` in enhanced auth success paths** - JWT-authenticated clients now correctly propagate identity downstream
  - Enhanced auth (JWT) success paths never captured `result.user_id` into `self.user_id`, so `inject_sender()` inserted `None` for JWT clients
  - Fixes immediate enhanced auth success, multi-step Continue→Success, and re-authentication success
  - Password auth was unaffected (already captured `user_id` correctly)

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.5] / [mqtt5 0.22.1] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.3] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.3] - 2026-02-01

### Security

- **Will message ACL enforcement** - Will messages now checked against ACL at publish time
  - Previously, will messages bypassed `authorize_publish()` entirely, allowing any authenticated client to publish to any topic by setting it as their will topic and disconnecting abnormally
  - All three will paths enforced: immediate (no delay), immediate (delay=0), and delayed (delay>0)
  - Delayed wills re-check ACL after the delay timer, catching rule changes between connect and disconnect
  - Applies to both native and WASM brokers

- **`x-mqtt-sender` identity injection** - Broker injects authenticated username as `x-mqtt-sender` user property on all PUBLISH packets
  - Strips any client-supplied `x-mqtt-sender` properties before injecting the real identity
  - Applies to both normal publishes and will messages
  - Prevents sender identity spoofing

- **`%u` ACL substitution hardened against wildcard injection** - Rejects usernames containing `+`, `#`, or `/` characters
  - Without this, a username like `+` would expand `$DB/u/%u/#` into `$DB/u/+/#`, matching all users' namespaces

### Added

- **`%u` ACL pattern substitution** - ACL topic patterns can use `%u` as a placeholder for the authenticated username
  - Enables per-user topic namespacing: `user * topic $DB/u/%u/# permission readwrite`
  - Works in both direct ACL rules and role-based rules
  - Anonymous clients never match `%u` patterns

- **Will message property forwarding** - Will messages now carry all MQTT v5 properties set at connect time
  - `payload_format_indicator`, `message_expiry_interval`, `content_type`, `response_topic`, `correlation_data`, and user properties
  - `WillProperties::apply_to_publish_properties()` helper on mqtt5-protocol

- **ACL management helpers** - Runtime ACL rule management
  - `AclManager::list_rules()`, `list_user_rules()`, `remove_rule()`
  - `PasswordAuthProvider::list_users()`

- **`ClientPublishEvent.user_id`** - Publish event now includes the authenticated user identity for event handlers

### Fixed

- **WASM transport Drop impls** - `BroadcastChannelWriter`, `MessagePortWriter`, and `WasmWriter` now properly clean up event handlers and close connections on drop
  - Prevents closure-after-drop panics in WASM environments

- **WASM WebSocket recursive mutex panic** - Replaced `Arc<Mutex<Option<oneshot::Sender>>>` with `Rc<Cell<Option<oneshot::Sender>>>` in WebSocket connect
  - The JS `onopen`/`onerror` callbacks run synchronously on the same thread, making `Mutex` prone to recursive locking

### Changed

- **`disconnect()` returns `Err(NotConnected)` when not connected** - Previously returned `Ok(())`
  - Callers that need the old behavior can match on `Err(MqttError::NotConnected)`

- **`build_will_properties` simplified** - Uses `WillProperties::into()` conversion instead of manual property-by-property construction

## [mqtt5 0.22.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.2] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.2] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **CompositeAuthProvider** - Chains a primary auth provider with a fallback; falls through to fallback on `BadAuthenticationMethod`, enabling mixed enhanced/password auth
- **`MqttBroker::auth_provider()`** - Getter to extract the broker's built auth provider for wrapping with `CompositeAuthProvider`

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.4] / [mqtt5 0.21.1] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.1] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- **Invalid packet_id initialization** - `PublishPacket::new` no longer sets packet_id to 0 for QoS > 0 (0 is not a valid MQTT packet identifier)

### Added

- Debug tracing for outgoing PUBLISH packets and retained message delivery

## [mqtt5 0.21.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
